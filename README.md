You can install the necessary packages using:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

## Dataset
The dataset consists of various environmental factors such as:

- Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium levels in soil
- Temperature and humidity
- pH value of soil
- Rainfall levels

## Usage
1. Open the `crop_recommendation.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the model, and generate recommendations.
3. Input the required environmental parameters to receive crop suggestions.
